# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:  
- Setosa  
- Versicolor 
- Virginica  

Using Scikit-learn’s Decision Tree Classifier, the model predicts the species based on flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

#📂 Dataset  
The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which consists of:  
- 150 samples (50 per species)  
- 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)  
- 3 target classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
